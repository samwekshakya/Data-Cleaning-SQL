# Data-Cleaning-SQL

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing data using MySQL. It involves performing the following key tasks:

1. Remove Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records from the dataset.
2. Standardize the Data: Ensuring consistent formatting and data types across columns.
3. Handle Null/Blank Values: Addressing missing or blank values by either populating them with appropriate values or deleting the affected rows.
4. Remove Unnecessary Column: Dropping columns that are no longer needed for analysis.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate essential data cleaning techniques to prepare datasets for analysis or reporting.
